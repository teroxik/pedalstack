    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Pedaling Dev</strong> — a software developer, minimalist bike traveler, and digital nomad documenting my journey across Europe one pedal stroke and code commit at a time.</p>

    <p>Right now, I’m based in <strong>Czechia</strong>, exploring local roads and bikepacking trails while fine-tuning my workflow for life on the move. My mission is to prove that you don’t need to be chained to a desk to build great software — just a bike, a laptop, a power source, and the will to make it work.</p>

    <h2>What is PedalStack.dev?</h2>

    <p><strong>PedalStack.dev</strong> is my space to share stories, setups, tools, and real-world lessons from working remotely while cycling full-time. Expect deep dives on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>⚙️ Dev gear and portable power setups</li>
      <li>🚴 Bikepacking tips for digital nomads</li>
      <li>📡 Staying connected in the middle of nowhere</li>
      <li>💻 My coding stack + remote workflow</li>
      <li>🗺️ Routes, maps, and life on two wheels</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who is this blog for?</h2>
    <p>If you’re a:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developer dreaming of remote freedom</li>
      <li>Adventure cyclist who codes on the side</li>
      <li>Curious nomad wondering if this lifestyle is even possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p>— then this blog is for you.</p>

    <h2>My Setup</h2>
    <p>I ride with a minimal bikepacking kit, an ultra-light development stack, and solar power whenever I can catch enough sun. Check out my full <a href="/gear">gear page</a> for the details.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
